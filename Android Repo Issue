This is because the repo packet in Ubuntu is actually not working properlyâ€¦
You can use the Google Repo binary with :

$ mkdir -p ~/.bin
$ PATH="${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}"
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo
$ chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo
Be sure to have python 3 installed.
